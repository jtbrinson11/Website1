    <p>Greetings, I am Joel Brinson. From an early age, I was very fascinated from computers. During my education, I took classes about computers such as Java programming, Game development, 3-D printing, etc. to learn more about them. Further fueled by my interest, I entered GenSpark to begin training to become a java Full Stack Developer. My goals are to become a software developer in any way possible, and eventually try leading a development team.</p>
